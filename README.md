# Bai 6. Tich hop database (lowdb)
## What to do
1) Thêm một file db.json vào project với nội dung như sau:

{
  "todos": [
    { "id": 1, "text": "blah" }
  ]
}

2) Sử dụng lowdb thay cho việc hard-code một array như các bài trước
Lưu ý: Khi thay đổi data type, bạn cần update lại những đoạn code consume data đó


# hello-express

A server that serves a webpage, its resources, and some data


## Your Project

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html` to change the content of the webpage
- `public/client.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `public/style.css` is the styles for `views/index.html`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
